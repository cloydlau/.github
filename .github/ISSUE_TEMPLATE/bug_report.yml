        - Try reproducing it in [StackBlitz](https://vite.new), [Vue 3 SFC Playground](https://play.vuejs.org) or a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/new)
        - [Why reproductions are required, and how to create one?](https://antfu.me/posts/why-reproductions-are-required)
        - <a href="https://pr.new"><img src="https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/start_pr_dark_small.svg" alt="Start new PR in StackBlitz Codeflow"></a> with failing tests, is a huge step towards maintainers or other contributors landing a fix
        - The best reproduction is the reproduction never sent - you find the problems/solutions during making the reproduction
        - The reproduction should contain only the bare minimum (but complete) amount of code needed to show the bug
        - Make reasonable efforts to troubleshoot and rule out issues with your own code or any 3rd party library
        - Enable incognito/private mode to avoid interference from browser extensions and caches

        What do we need to do after opening your repro in order to make the bug happen? Clear and concise reproduction instructions are important for us to be able to triage your issue in a timely manner. Note that you can use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to format lists and code, avoid code screenshots
