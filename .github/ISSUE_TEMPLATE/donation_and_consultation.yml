        > We have encountered and handled a large number of inquiries and requests for assistance, but actually, the vast majority of them can be resolved through more appropriate channels, such as reading document/[GitSummarize](https://gitsummarize.com), asking [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com)/[DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com)/[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), searching, using [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask), and GitHub Discussions.
